# Anime Discordbot

To take advantage of my [Anime Slackbot](https://github.com/jrock2004/anime-slackbot), I created this discord bot to use this to look up information on your favorite anime. This is the first Discord Bot I have created.

## Run the Project

To run the project, you will want to clone the project and do a `yarn install`. Then create an `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following:

```
ANIME_TOKEN=
BOT_TOKEN=
```

After you put those in you can do `yarn start`.
